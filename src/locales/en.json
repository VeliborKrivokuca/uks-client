The table shows the minimum applicable fee, while the complexity of the work, the expertise and reputation of the composer, the urgency required or the special requirements of the order may result in a higher fee. The values are presented as percentages in relation to the minimum wage in the Republic of Serbia, so it is understood that it is important to update each time you use them. The ethical obligation of all actors in the order is to openly present in advance all the listed, additional and accompanying costs, which are conditioned by the creation of a sound work of art, before agreeing on any kind of cooperation.",
